# Swords-and-Sources
A short rogue-lite video game. You play as a slime who tries to make their way out of Cee-Ester Castle.

# Backstory
I first developed this project for an English 1101 project, but I have been updating it occasioanlly since then.
I will keep updating the game until all the features I planned are included, and all placeholder assests are replaced.
This project also serves as a small prototype for a larger project currently in design phase.
